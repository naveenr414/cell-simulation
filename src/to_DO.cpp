LOOK AT NOTE BELOW: DH is an integer.
  It did create problems - not sure why.
  The problem was that cells all tend to move to south west when in group.
  MAYBE fixed - turned DH to a double.
  

To Do list for project
- make patches of food in two ways:
  1) a patch stays in place longer (so that cells have time to react to that)
  2) food self replicates like e. coli (food grows adjacent to food)
  
NOTE: DH is an integer. 
      This can create problems when multiplying with a factor in [0,1] as we do now...
- make movement as an evolvable response to food
  1) x make energy dependent food (allocate particles to maintenance or movement)
     - let decision whether mu = startmu (or whatever, maybe evolvable) be in dish
     - also how much movement happens should perhaps be a function of cell size?
  2) - let allocation to resources vs movement be evolvable, and a function of food
  3) - let that function evolve itself,
  4) - There should be the possibility of having multiple (at least two) key/locks

- TEST: if target area too large, it does not grow anymore!
        But food IS consumed

- Make MAX particles in Dish::CellsEat() a parameter of class cell
- Make possibility for spatial gradients IN THE FUTURE there could be some spatial gradient?
- Make backups, especially to locally restart simulations
  and make pretty videos.
  This is a big thing, and should include the following:
  - there is an initial "no migration" phase,
    which should be an alternative function when you start from scratch
    but you should not screw up the time counter
  - let command line argument and parameter file handle backup (or ONLY command line?)
  - write function that outputs complete info about the field
  - write function that begins simulation from backup

- date of birth might be buggy (is it still?)

NO - Implement Ioana's method for persistent walk... and read the paper!
  -> renske's criticism:
     computational load
     connectivity
     big cells to see effect
- introduce biased sustained random walk, esp for predators
NO - introduce a life span parameter, that tells if a cell must die (e.g. due to oxydative stress or whatever...)
  could be re-zeroed everytime a cell reproduces... I guess?
- [SOLVED?]there is something odd: when predate function is on,
  prey cells can become very big for a little while...
  does not happen when predate function is off
  WHY??? Is this true always? TEST!!!
- Better random number generator
- gitHub
- Findcelldirections() may make huge mistakes across borders,
  this can screw up symmetry of cell division; see Findcelldirections2()


DONE
- BUGS: mother did not get resources halved!
- TWO MAJOR OPTIMISIATIONS:
  1- Remove cells used to go through the whole field to remove a dead cell,
     now it starts from the center of mass and goes further out until
     it removed the whole area of the cell (factor 10 optimisation).
  2- intplane update (IncreaseValEverywhere and IncreaseValIfEmpty)
     used to go throught the whole field and check for probability
     of increasing food which is a lot of unsuccessful calls to random number generator,
     now we just ask beforehand howmany pixels we update (factor 2 opt.).
- MAJOR BUG IN Dish::CellGrowthAndDivision2(void) AND ALL OF VERSIONS BEFORE
  was: if( c->TargetArea() > 2*c->half_div_area) // TARGET AREA ?????????
  is now: if( c->Area() > 2*c->half_div_area)
- initialise variables for target vector position correctly
- output is flushed when generated (anyway,
  I write a lot of lines in one go, and a big png file)
- fixed some leaks due to allocation of PDE  plane (which I am not using)
- food influx location: toggle between
  everywhere (independent of cell position and identity),
  only where there are no prey
  nowhere
  -> in this case all other parameters should be zeroed
- eatprob is local to each cell
- Check that key-lock length is extendable to longer lenght
(and maybe make a function parser for trnaslatinf a key locks into J values?
or at least something scalable)
- temperature might be a bit high - fixed, now it is 20
- Neighbour size is back to 2 to avoid anisotropy, Neigh=2 is the Moore neigh
- Fixed (some cells are dead): everybody should have a neighbour, why is this not true when I print them?
- mutations happen...
- Evolution of adhesion as key-lock mechanism:
- ca.cpp DivideCells should return vector daughter_sigma
which should be updated with the sigmas of the new cells
and returned to dish.cpp CellGrowthanddivision2 where
the new contact nrg should be updated for everybody for this sigma

- Random number generator ported to c++11 <random>:
  somewhat tested (for uniqueness of function call,
                   for consistency with seed,
                   graphically for randomness)
- added predator division area of predators in command line arguments
- read command line argument (stump in parameters.cpp)
  (useful for working on cluster to redirect output)
- check if directory for movie exists, exit if it does,
  create it if it does not.
- improve colouring of the field: shade the food where there is a predator underneath
- change name of png output
- Fixed: it seems that introduction of medium from outer space is buggy:
it happens in a very synchronised manner for all (or most) cells.
- set neighbourhood size to 1 to avoid predators from eating
  beyond contact
- give copying a probability of copying medium from outer space (to fix the energy of vacuum effect)
- check that cells have the right neighbours all the times <-- THIS IS PARAMOUNT
  (expecially when they cross CA boundaries)
- checked that contacts are correctly assigned after Renske remark 21/06/18
- area below which a cell is set to die is now a parameter
- debug initcontact length (all kinds of things were buggy, e.g. infinite while loop)
- how to properly exit when poulation goes exitinct? Calling exit(0) is the right way
- check if directory for movie exists,
    if yes - do not start the simulation,
    if no - create and then start simulation
- save data to file in some way
- make parameters for predation user-defined
- Cell's ID should recycled after cell death
- movies saved somewhere
- predation
neighbour tracking implemented
- cells have a map neighbors which works like
  {id: pair(amount of contact in pixels, duration of contact)}

cell removed when too small (area<5)
- this fixes that issue that full field cells are still present
  because they cannot disappear
