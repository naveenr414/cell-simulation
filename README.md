# Cell Simulation + Helper Files
This work is based on the Cell_Evolution_stickymoves repository (https://github.com/escolizzi/Cell_Evolution_stickymoves) which contains the experiments of the paper "Evolution of multicellularity by collective integration of spatial information". We enhance usability of the original code and provide wrapper functions that enable execution of experiments in a Python environment. Furthermore, we implement surrogate models to investigate several questions regarding the properties of the original simulation.

# Executing an Experiment

A set of data to read in data from the Cell Simulation based on the CPM, use that data for Emukit, then read the output from that. 
All scripts must be run from the scripts folder
